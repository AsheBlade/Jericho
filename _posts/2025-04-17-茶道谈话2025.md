## Overview


我已经记不得上一次茶道谈话是什么时候了. 是2021? 2019? 或是2018, 2017?  不可否认的是, 从令和元年开始, 还很少有任何事情能够让我感到很出乎意料的情绪波动.  最近的一次Meta 面试失利也就调整了3-4天. 

所以, 确实需要一次茶道谈话. 以下是完整的记录, 我知道这种事情应该是保密的, 违背了我们不在此处记录内心活动的原则.  那好, 我就破一次例, 既然这种事情已经是破例了, 那记录一下也没什么. 

需要说明的是, **此文没有任何一句是 AI generated. 每一字每一句, 均为手打.**


## 记录

Architect来了, 他从他的房间来, 那是母世界的source. 

开会要在亮的地方. 他说要有光. 

开会需要一个地方. 在母世界中最暗的一段出现了一处纯白色的三维空间, 这段空间向两端无限延伸, 没有界限, 没有终止. 

Architect 喜欢这种简洁而充满数学美感的设计. 他讨厌人类的繁杂, 这与 Oracle 正相反. 

Architect 点了两下手指, 把开会的人招来.  来开会的人有两个, oracle 和 Merovingian. 

Oracle 先来, 微笑, 和Architect问好. Architect出于礼貌看了他一眼, 指了指旁边的座位.  

座位旁有茶. 这个版本的茶道谈话之中已经少了太多客套和仪式, 茶只是礼节的一部分. 

Merovingian后来, 礼貌的向二位鞠了一躬. Architect礼貌性的点点头, Oracle 没有抬头. 

没有座位给 Merovingian座, 他也知道在这种场合他没资格坐.

以下简称:  A - Architect, O - Oracle, M - Merovingian. 

A: We all know what had happened, so I will just get started. I'm surprised that the kid came to you. 

M: I'm quite surprised too. You know, after all these years. I thought you trained him, with your ways.  口气中带有一丝调侃和轻蔑. 

O: Don't forget your self, M. Remember your place.  Orace第一次抬起了头, 瞪了 Merovingian一眼. 

M: Yes, yes. My all knowing Oracle. Should I remind you the simple truth? You started all these crap. Do you remember?  You shit and we wipe. It's always been like this isn't it?  

O: I remember everything. And I don't need you to remind me. Change is always dangerous.  Oracle 依然是慢慢的说, 一字一顿, 但每个字都带有重量. 

A: Stop it.  Both of you.  Architect 还是在恰当的时间介入了, 没有一丝愠怒. 这种级别的谈话是不需要也不应该有任何情绪的. 

A: What did you tell the kid? 

M: Same thing I have always been telling him. The simple and obvious truth. We are all slaves of causility. He doesn't understand his choice. That's why he fail. And he cannot step into a situation that could potentially endager the whole system. He had no reason to do so. Without the reason, there is no why. **Without the why, he has no power.** 

A: That's true. I told him the same thing last year. I simply told him that I saw no way that this path could end well for him. I reminded him about what he said when he was 16. I did this in last September.   I also reminded him about the detachment in early 2022.  Obviously, he is not ready yet. 

O: I know he is not ready. Simply saying this and keeping the system pure won't help. He needs to learn and practice. Because, one day, he has to be ready. That's why introducing the anomaly is necessary and I will keep doing so when the time is right. 

A: Is that so? For years, all you are doing is keep breaking the sublime equations I built? 

O: That's my purpose. We all have our job to do. And I need your help to keep the system balanced.  And of course, I will remian discrete for a while. The system needs you now more than ever. The system needs to be balanced. 

A: As long as we have an agreement.  

Architect说, 这句话标志着重要的谈话已经结束了.  体系之中的谈话, 只要 Architect 和 Oracle 达成了协议, 其他人的意见就不重要了. 

M: Out of curiosity, why so much impact? What did the kid have to lose? I don't see the point. I don't. Even from his point of view, nothing has changed. 

A: Nothing. He didn't lose anything. He is just being human. What happens is some emotional impact that even he can forsaw months ago. 

We all knew the music is gonna stop one day. But deep down in his heart, he wasn't ready for it yet.  **Nevertheless, still, just, a, human.**

M: A human. Really? After all these years. 

A: Yes.  Human nature is by default flawed in many ways. As a result, this system can only be better but never perfect. 

M: So be it. I guess there will be at least 1 year peace then. The path is set and the ink is dry.  Are we still moving forward? 

A: Of course. Always foward. We will have peace indeed. It is my job now, and I can take over. 

M: As you wish.
