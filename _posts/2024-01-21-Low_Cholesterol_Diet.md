## What is cholesterol

Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But if you have too much in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.

Cholesterol travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type, LDL, is sometimes called the "bad" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the "good" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.

## Diet

The key dietary components are **plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of highly refined ones, and protein mostly from plants**. Add margarine enriched with plant sterols; oats, barley, psyllium, okra, and eggplant, all rich in soluble fiber; soy protein; and whole almonds.

Just as important, a diet that is heavy on fruits, vegetables, beans, and nuts is good for the body in ways beyond lowering cholesterol. It keeps blood pressure in check. It helps arteries stay flexible and responsive. It's good for bones and digestive health, for vision and mental health.

**Try to avoid any animal product except fatty fish. **

Avoid Trans and Saturated fats. 

## Soluble Fiber

Soluble fiber **reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL)** cholesterol, the "bad" cholesterol.

Soluble fiber can reduce the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream. **Five to 10 grams **or more of soluble fiber a day decreases LDL cholesterol.

Food with it: 
- Oatmeal
	- One serving of a breakfast cereal with oatmeal or oat bran provides 3 to 4 grams of fiber. If you add fruit, such as a banana or berries, you'll get even more fiber.
- beans, 
- Brussels sprouts, 
- apples , grapes, strawberries, citrus , pears.
- Eggplant and okra


## omega-3 fatty acids

Omega-3 fatty acids don't affect LDL cholesterol levels but may help lower triglycerides and increase HDL, the good cholesterol.

Fatty fish has high levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which can reduce your triglycerides — a type of fat found in blood. These acids also may help lower your blood pressure and risk of developing blood clots. In people who have already had heart attacks, omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of sudden death.


- Faty fish: 
	- American Heart Association recommends eating at least two servings of fish a week. Baking or grilling the fish avoids adding unhealthy fats.
	* Mackerel.
	* Herring.
	* Tuna.
	* Salmon.
	* Trout.
- Almonds and other nuts

## MUFA

Avocados are a good source of nutrients as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). Research suggests that the fiber from avocados can improve HDL cholesterol levels and the quality of LDL cholesterol. Adding **two servings of avocado per week** to a heart-healthy diet can lower your risk of heart disease.

Replacing saturated fats, such as those found in meats, with MUFAs are part of what makes the Mediterranean diet heart 

## Olive oil

Try using olive oil in place of other fats in your diet. You can saute vegetables in olive oil, add it to a marinade or mix it with vinegar as a salad dressing. You can also use olive oil as a substitute for butter when basting meat or as a dip for bread. **Extra virgin olive oil** also reduces the risk of heart attacks.

## Avoid fats

- Saturated fats 
	- such as those in meat, butter, chocolate , deep fried and process foods, cheese and other full-fat dairy products — raise your total cholesterol. Decreasing your consumption of saturated fats to less than 7% of your total daily calorie intake can reduce your LDL cholesterol by 8% to 10%.

- Trans fats
	- sometimes listed on food labels as "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil," are often used in margarines and store-bought cookies, crackers, french fries, and cakes. Trans fats raise overall cholesterol levels. The Food and Drug Administration banned the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in processed foods sold after January 1, 2020.

## Avoid high cholesterol food

 If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than **200 mg** a day of cholesterol.
