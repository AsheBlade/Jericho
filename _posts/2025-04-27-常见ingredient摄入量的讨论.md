# Overview

这个原本写于2023-06-20, 起因是Faye提醒了我美国果汁会加入糖的问题, 所以开个帖子讨论一下常见的ingredient 的安全摄入量. 

最近大幅度更新, 所以改了时间. 

感谢她启发我写这个, 感谢她给我正确的饮食理念.

# Sugar

根据 [American Heart Association的建议](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much): 

- Men should consume no more than (**36 grams** or 150 calories) of added sugar per day.

1g sugar contains 4 calories. So basically, all the calories in any juice are provided by sugar. You are not drinking juice, you are drinking sugar.  It is not added sugar though, but the taste is still from sugar. 

**所以原则是尽量不实用任何添加糖.** 但基于添加糖是一个快速补充能量的途径, 这不是一个铁律. 特殊情况是可以打破的.

2025-04-14 更新: 最近基本不吃任何添加糖了, 所以要留意一下[含糖高的水果](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/fruits-high-in-sugar). 其实还好, 水果主要还是管住嘴, 少吃几个. 很多升糖不高的水果比方说西瓜, 其实吃多才会升糖. 

## 对比标准

什么算糖多, 什么算糖少.  我目前的标准是可乐. 我们认为糖摄入量超过一听可乐的都算多.

一听可乐是上限, 其实一听可乐已经超过了日摄入量的36g. 

## Food swap strategy

Food swap strategy for added sugar

* Swap blueberry flavored yogurt for plain yogurt with fresh blueberries added
* Use avocado as a condiment instead of mayonnaise
* Salsa instead of ketchup
* Oil and vinegar instead of processed salad dressing (需要努力实施)
* Coconut water instead of juice with lots of sugar and calories
* Sparkling water rather than soda
* Always drink black coffee. There is no excuse. 
* There is no point for having a desert in restaurants. Go home and eat your blueberry. 
* 用sparkling water 替代无糖可乐, 用水果替代冰激凌. 注意多食用低糖水果. 长期的话, 要找东西替代凤梨. 

## FAQ

### Why natural sugar good and added sugar bad? 

According to [ucsd](https://chear.ucsd.edu/blog/understanding-natural-versus-added-sugars)

Fruits and dairy contain fructose and lactose, natural sugar that is digested slower than added sugar and keeps your metabolism stable over time. Sugars found naturally in food are more than enough to sustain your body. **Natural sugars are processed more slowly, meaning your blood glucose level stays elevated for a longer period.**

Added sugars are typically processed quickly, either immediately used for energy or sent directly to the liver for fat storage. **Your blood glucose level drops quickly after eating added sugars, known as a sugar crash, that leaves you hungry, irritable, and usually craving another pickup**. When this happens, you may not be able to make smart choices about what and how much to eat which could contribute to weight gain.

### What does "No added sugars" actually means? 

No added sugars or without added sugars means that no sugars or sugar-containing ingredients were added during processing

### Why is sugar inflammatory?

Sugar can promote inflammation due to several mechanisms. Primarily, excessive sugar intake can lead to weight gain and increased fat storage, which can cause inflammation. Additionally, high sugar consumption disrupts the gut microbiome, favoring inflammation-promoting bacteria and altering the gut's permeability. Furthermore, sugar can stimulate the production of free fatty acids in the liver, and these fatty acids, upon digestion, can trigger inflammatory responses. 


# Fat

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

You should limit both total fat and saturated fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats, and less than 7% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum amounts of fats that you should eat:

Calories per Day | 	Total Fat	| Saturated Fat
|------|------|------
1,500	| 42-58 grams |	10 grams
2,000	| 56-78 grams	| 13 grams
2,500	| 69-97 grams	| 17 grams

Saturated fat is a bad fat because it raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.

Trans fat is another bad fat; it can raise your LDL and lower you HDL (good cholesterol). Trans fat is mostly in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine, crackers, and french fries.

Instead of these bad fats, try healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils.

# Salt

TLDR: 基本上所有人都过分摄入盐. 尽可能少吃. 

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

You should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat to** no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day**. That includes all the sodium you eat, whether it was added in cooking or at the table, or already present in food products. 

Limiting salt can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood pressure. You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and "no added salt" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking.

# cholesterol

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than **200 mg** a day of cholesterol.

# Protein

- Salmon > other fish > red meat. 

- Soy protein bad


## FAQ

### Why soy protein bad? 

- source: [harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/impossible-and-beyond-how-healthy-are-these-meatless-burgers-2019081517448), [Dr Maille Devlin](https://www.mailledevlin.com/post/beyond-meat-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly)

- It's highly processed and contain several additives and inflammatory oils
- Beyond protein, it contains much less ingredients than red meat. 
- high in saturated fat ->  increased rates of both heart disease and premature death
- high sodium


# 一些食物讨论

## Cheese

❌

Cheese is a great source of protein and calcium but is often high in saturated fat and salt. 
Protein 不缺, calcium可以用其他方式补充, 加上我并没有奶酪依赖.  所以选择不吃. 

## Pineapple

❌

[凤梨在升糖指数高的水果中排名末尾 ](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/fruits-high-in-sugar) 虽然, 凤梨其实既好吃[又健康.](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-pineapple) It's a good source of vitamin C, manganese, fiber, and several B vitamins. 但是它不符合 Keto diet. 

以下来自GPT: 

> 凤梨（菠萝）不太适合严格的 keto diet（生酮饮食），原因如下：
> 
> 1. 碳水含量较高   
> 每 100 克凤梨含有大约 13 克净碳水（total carbs - fiber），而严格的生酮饮食通常要求每天摄入净碳水低于 20–50 克。一杯凤梨就可能占用你一天一半甚至大部分的碳水预算。
> 
> 2. 血糖反应较快    
> 凤梨的 升糖指数（GI）偏高，容易引发血糖和胰岛素波动，不利于保持酮症状态。


## 酒精

❌

- 2025-03-23: 酒精分解的乙酸是一类致癌物, 跟烟和甲醛草是一个等级的.  End of story, 从此决定尽可能不喝酒(一年1-2次), 除非特别礼仪场合. 

根据[香港卫生署](https://www.chp.gov.hk/sc/features/103676.html#:~:text=%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E5%8D%AB%E7%94%9F%E7%BB%84%E7%BB%87%E8%BE%96%E4%B8%8B,%E9%A5%AE%E9%85%92%E5%B9%B6%E6%B2%A1%E6%9C%89%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E3%80%82), **酒精是一种有毒物质**，会直接和间接影响身体多个器官和系统。世界卫生组织辖下的国际癌症研究机构亦已把酒精列为「对人类致癌」（即**第一类致癌物**），与烟草、电离辐射和石棉等属同一类别，可引致多种癌症。就引致癌症的风险而言，饮酒并没有安全水平。

酒精会影响肝脏的碳水化合物代谢和影响血糖水平，含高热量，却没有营养价值。每克酒精约提供7千卡热量，差不多是碳水化合物（如糖）或蛋白质所含热量的两倍（两者每克均提供4千卡）。一罐／细樽啤酒（330 亳升， 5%酒精浓度）可以含有大概140千卡。而一杯红酒（175毫升， 13%酒精浓度）亦可以含有大概160千卡。因此，不论饮何类型酒精都会增加肥胖的机会，因而增加患上糖尿病的风险。

要减低患上糖尿病及其他疾病的风险，都是不饮酒为上策。

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. 


One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor, and the recommendation is that:

* Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day
* Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day


## 红肉

❌

- 加工肉制品是一类致癌物
- 红肉是二类致癌物.  有些研究建议每周食用 12 - 18 ounces. 

总结就是最好别吃. 红肉富含较多的营养而salmon没有的就是铁.  这个可以用 clam 替代: Once a week. 

详细回答, from GPT: 

### Is red meat carcinogenic?

* Yes, but not in all contexts. 
* The problem is frequent consumption of high-temperature cooked (grilled, barbecued, fried) red meat (beef, pork, lamb).
* Processed red meats (like bacon, ham, sausage) are confirmed Class 1 carcinogens.
* Pure, lightly cooked, clean-sourced red meat (e.g., slow-cooked, boiled, or stewed beef) is much lower risk, but still moderation is wise.

Bottom line:

> Red meat itself is not pure poison, but daily, large quantities, especially grilled or fried = risky.


### Why is red meat hard to replace?

Because it provides heme iron —
the form of iron that your body absorbs best (much better than plant iron).

Salmon is excellent — very healthy —
but salmon is low in iron compared to red meat.

If you totally cut red meat, you need to watch for iron deficiency, especially if you are physically active or aiming to become stronger (which I suspect you are, based on your dark oath philosophy).

### Replacement

Shellfish (clams, oysters, mussels): Very high with Iron. Clams especially - extremely high in heme iron.  Eat it once a week. 

## 鱿鱼

🟠 Can be safe

Condition | Advice
---|---
Squid fried, battered, crispy | 🚫 Avoid (bad fats + oxidized cholesterol = high heart risk)
Squid boiled, grilled, lightly cooked | ✅ Safe if moderate (1–2 times a week, portion <100g)
Huge portions (like >300g per meal) | ⚠️ Risky (too much pure cholesterol load)
