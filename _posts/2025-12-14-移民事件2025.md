## 03-06 revoke student visas over 'pro-Hamas'

The US state department will use artificial intelligence to revoke visas of foreign students who it perceives as supporters of Hamas, Axios reported on Thursday, citing senior state department officials.

Donald Trump signed an executive order in January to combat antisemitism and has pledged to deport non-citizen college students and others who took part in pro-Palestinian protests that have been ongoing for months amid Israel’s military assault on Gaza after Hamas’s October 2023 attack.

> Congress needs to end China’s exploitation of our student visa program. It’s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.


As of the current date, the bill's status on Congress.gov indicates it has not passed the Senate or the House.

> WASHINGTON— Today U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will begin considering aliens’ antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests. This will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity.  

> Consistent with President Trump’s executive orders on Combatting Anti-Semitism, Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism and Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats, DHS will enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: “the Houthis.”

- Forbes [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/05/22/snubbing-trump-immigration-nominee-will-end-student-practical-training/)

> “I think the way in which OPT has been handled over the past four years, with the help of certain decisions coming out of the D.C. Circuit Court, have been a real problem in terms of misapplication of the law,” Edlow said in response. “What I want to see would be essentially a regulatory and sub-regulatory program that would allow us to remove the ability for employment authorizations for F-1 students beyond the time that they are in school.”


## 05-28 美国国务院开始取消中国学生签证

- [New Visa Policies Put America First, Not China ](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/05/new-visa-policies-put-america-first-not-china)

> Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong.


## 06-05 Judge blocked Trump's Harvard ban

> "FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA. LIKEWISE, WE WILL PROVIDE TO CHINA WHAT WAS AGREED TO, INCLUDING CHINESE STUDENTS USING OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES (WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD WITH ME!)," Trump said.

此次日内瓦谈判基本抵消了 05-28 取消中国学生签证的政策. 


## 06-11 Denaturalization Task Force

- DOJ [source](https://www.justice.gov/civil/media/1404046/dl?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

DOJ 恢复并强化对已入籍公民的 denaturalization（撤销国籍）优先级

> The Department of Justice may institute civil proceedings to revoke a person’s United States
citizenship if an individual either “illegally procured” naturalization or procured naturalization
by “concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.” 8 U.S.C. § 1451(a). The
benefits of civil denaturalization include the government’s ability to revoke the citizenship of
individuals who engaged in the commission of war crimes, extrajudicial killings, or other serious
human rights abuses; to remove naturalized criminals, gang members, or, indeed, any individuals
convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the United States; and to prevent convicted
terrorists from returning to U.S. soil or traveling internationally on a U.S. passport. 

## 06-17 IRS与ICE分享数据

- PBS [report](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/irs-to-share-personal-data-with-immigration-agents-to-aid-deportation-efforts): IRS to share personal data with immigration agents to aid deportation efforts

## 08-11 H1B Weighted Selection

- Bloomberg [source](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/h-1b-worker-weighted-selection-rule-clears-white-house-review)

## 08-26 Trump welcomes Chinese students

- Forbes News [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annaesakismith/2025/08/27/trump-says-he-welcomes-600000-chinese-students-to-us-in-sharp-reversal/)


> President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would permit 600,000 Chinese students to study at American universities, a sharp pivot from his administration’s earlier stance on tightening visa restrictions for this student cohort. The 600,000 figure is also more than double the number of Chinese students studying in this country in 2023-2024.
> 
> “We are going to allow it,” Trump said during a White House meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, according to an Associated Press story. “It’s very important—600,000 students.”
> 
> Trump reiterated this sentiment during a Cabinet meeting the next day, saying that Chinese students help keep U.S. colleges and universities financially afloat, according to the AP story.
> 
> “I told (Chinese) President Xi that we’re honored to have their students here,” Trump said. “Now, with that, we check and we’re careful, we see who is there.”

- [source](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/dhs-is-planning-to-set-ds-limit-for-fji-status/)

> 目前这个政策对大家影响比较大的应该有：
> 
> - Day 1 CPT，许多Phd可以选择再读一个Master然后Day 1参加CPT马上开始工作，这条路被堵死了；
> - 禁止研究生阶段的转学或者换专业，等于读PhD不能去别的学校。即使- 自己的PhD老板出了各种问题比如跳槽，也不能跟着转学，需要在本学校的本专业硬着头皮读完才行；
> - 在美国读了一个硕士对专业不满意，想读二硕转码，这种情况连签证申请的资格都没有；
> - 读PhD期间选择硕士毕业Master Out跑路目前还没有定论，从论坛讨论倾向认为是可以的。

## 09-02 F1, H1B 续签面试取消

- 国务院 [source](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/interview-waiver-update-july-25-2025.html)


> Effective September 2, 2025, the Department of State will update the categories of applicants that may be eligible for a waiver of the nonimmigrant visa interview. All nonimmigrant visa applicants, including applicants under the age of 14 and over the age of 79, will generally require an in-person interview with a consular officer except:   
>     
> Applicants classifiable under the visa symbols A-1, A-2, C-3 (except attendants, servants, or personal employees of accredited officials), G-1, G-2, G-3, G-4, NATO-1 through NATO-6, or TECRO E-1;    
> Applicants for diplomatic- or official-type visas; and
> Applicants renewing a full validity B-1, B-2, B1/B2 visa or a Border Crossing Card/Foil (for Mexican nationals) within 12 months of the prior visa’s expiration, and who were at least 18 years old at the time of the prior visa’s issuance.

- Guardian [source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/07/300-south-koreans-detained-at-hyundai-plant-in-us-to-be-released-says-seoul)

It was **the largest single-site enforcement operation ever carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to date**

> South Korea announced on Sunday that the roughly 300 of its nationals detained during an immigration raid in Georgia would be released and flown home, as the sudden detention of workers appeared to strain the longstanding diplomatic and economic relationship between the two countries.

演变成[外交事件](https://time.com/7315143/ice-raid-georgia-south-korea/), 韩国外交部回应: 

> Park Yoon-joo, South Korea’s first vice-foreign minister, reportedly told the US under secretary of state for political affairs, Allison Hooker, that it was lamentable the raid unfolded “at a critical time, when the momentum of trust and cooperation between the two leaders, forged through their first summit, must be maintained”.
> 
>“The economic activities of our companies that have invested in the US and the rights and interests of our citizens should not be unfairly infringed upon during the course of US law enforcement,” Park also said, according to a foreign ministry statement.

## 09-11 国务卿警告不要glorify violence

Kirk 遇刺后, deputy secretary of state 发[推特](https://x.com/DeputySecState/status/1966114506116927972)

> In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country. I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action. Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the @StateDept can protect the American people.


警告并不是随便唬人的, [后续证实](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0x4e3zn2jo)确实有人因为发布相关网络言论导致 Visa revoked.

> NASA has banned Chinese citizens with US visas from participating in agency programs — a dramatic escalation in the space race between China and the United States. It occurs as China gears up to send a crewed mission to land and potentially establish a habitat on the moon, about which the Trump administration has expressed increasing alarm.

> At the beginning of the 119th Congress, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched an investigation into six U.S. universities—University of Maryland, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Southern California, Purdue University, and Stanford University. These universities—public and private, large and small, and geographically diverse—were asked a series of questions regarding the presence and research activities of Chinese national students on their campuses. Namely, the Select Committee sought information about where these students previously studied, how their education is funded, what type of research they are conducting, and the extent of each university’s institutional and faculty-level collaboration with China. 

## 09-26 交通部提议吊销非法移民的商业驾照

> The US will reexamine all green cards issued to people from 19 countries “of concern” at President Donald Trump’s direction, as the Trump administration intensifies its immigration crackdown following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC.

## 12-04  5 year EAD is no more

- USCIS [source](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-increases-screening-vetting-of-aliens-working-in-us)

EAD 期限从最长5年缩短至18months.  **新闻中主要只针对庇护和难民, 是否确实影响OPT和 EB存在争议**. 政策跟national guard被袭击事件相关. 

> The reduced maximum validity periods for certain categories will result in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for authorization to work in the United States. Vetting an alien more often will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the United States.

>“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies. After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens.” said Director Joseph Edlow.

## 12-04 USCIS会查Linkedln

之所以引用非官方source是因为这个dp符合之前提到过的要加大审查SNS的新闻. 

## 12-05 US could ask foreign tourists for five-year social media history

- BBC [source](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dz0g2ykpeo)

新闻报道中说消息来源是 美国驻墨西哥使馆. 但笔者没有查到相关信息. 不过根据最近的新闻, 这条消息为真的可能性较大. 

Trump 被记者问相关问题的时候没有否认相关消息. 

> An announcement on the website for the US Embassy and Consulate in Mexico states certain visa applicants must list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used in the last five years.


## 12-09 B签失效的人在婚绿面试时被逮捕遣返
