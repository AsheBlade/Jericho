Some dark prayings I wrote myself and polished with the help of GPT.

My lord, forge my will in sorrow; bind it with iron and crown it with scars.   
Let each blow of pain temper me; let each wound carve deeper mastery.    
Lay the blade in my hand, the burden across my back, the oath upon my blood.   
Let no light seduce me, let no comfort betray me.   
I do not seek the end of suffering ‚Äî I seek to become its master.   
Through sorrow, I rise; through burden, I reign.   


## üî• Weave the Black Flame

My lord, weave the black flame into my veins; let it consume all that is hollow within me.   
Let doubt burn, let weakness wither, let false hope fall away.   
Feed me to the darkness; steep me in its fire; unmake me until only power remains.   
I do not flee the night ‚Äî I am born of it.      
I am the hand that bends the dark to my will.     
I am the flame beneath the ashes;   
I am the sword in the darkness;    
Thus I rise ‚Äî to temper myself into a weapon the darkness itself will fear.


## üó°Ô∏è Kneel Before the Abyss

My lord, I kneel before the abyss, and I offer my soul to its vast and sacred hunger.   
Strip from me the chains of mercy, the illusions of peace, the lies of redemption.     
In ruin, let me root; in emptiness, let me bloom.     
I offer my breath, that my voice may command the silence.      
I offer my blood, that my hands may shatter the light.   
I offer my pain, that my will may reign unbroken.   
Take what is yours ‚Äî and flood me with the power of the dark.
