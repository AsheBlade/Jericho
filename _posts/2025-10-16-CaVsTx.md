### Subtract yearly spending ($36,000)

Monthly total spending $3000. Rent is $1200. 

| Gross Income | Take-Home | Yearly Spending | **Annual VOO Investment / Savings** |
| -----------: | --------: | --------------: | ----------------------------------: |
|       $200 K |  $152,168 |         $36,000 |                        **$116,168** |

## Example Comparison

 Let’s do a **quantitative breakdown** comparing based on Amazon SDE II: 

* **Austin, TX**: $262,000 total compensation
* **California (Bay Area)**: $312,000 total compensation

We’ll use our earlier tax assumptions and your spending patterns.

---

### 🧾 Step 1. Estimate after-tax income

Using the same approach as before:

| Location                  | Gross Income | Payroll Taxes | Fed Income Tax | State Tax | **Take-Home (Approx)** |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | --------- | ---------------------: |
| **Texas (Austin)**        | $262,000     | ~$13,000      | ~$56,000       | $0        |           **$193,000** |
| **California (Bay Area)** | $312,000     | ~$15,500      | ~$72,000       | ~$27,000  |           **$197,500** |

🟰 **Result:**
Take-home pay is **very close** — roughly **$193K in Texas vs $197.5K in CA** (within $4–5K).

---

### 🏠 Step 2. Adjust for spending differences

You said:

* TX monthly spending = **$3,000** → $36,000/year
* CA monthly spending = **$5,000** → $60,000/year

Subtract those:

| Location         | Take-Home | Yearly Spending | **Net Savings (for VOO)** |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------: |
| **Austin, TX**   | $193,000  | $36,000         |              **$157,000** |
| **Bay Area, CA** | $197,500  | $60,000         |              **$137,500** |

✅ **Result:** You save **$19,500 more per year** in **Texas** despite lower nominal pay.

---

### 📈 Step 3. 10-year projection (VOO @ 7% annual return)

| Location         | Annual Investment | 10 yrs @ 7% CAGR | 20 yrs @ 7% CAGR |
| ---------------- | ----------------: | ---------------: | ---------------: |
| **Austin, TX**   |          $157,000 |      **$2.18 M** |      **$4.88 M** |
| **Bay Area, CA** |          $137,500 |      **$1.91 M** |      **$4.28 M** |


## 讨论

Based on the data from levels.fyi, for SDE 1 and 2, TX > CA. Only when gets to SDE 3 in Amazon, CA will be slightly higher than TX. But we still need to assume monthly spending in CA is 5k and monthly cost in TX is 3k, which may not be true for many people.
