## Overview

Artemis 伴我渡过了2016-2019 这一段人生最晦暗的岁月. 她曾经是我的崇拜和我的依靠. 

我最喜欢她的冷漠. 她柔性的力量美, 不带一丝犹豫和情感.  Stoic. 

说的更准确一点, 我不是崇拜她这个神. 而是崇拜古希腊的那种精神. 

- 对真理的孜孜不倦的追求.  永远用最直接最直观的方法去表达思想. 
- 对力与美的表现. 思想和利剑.

## Prayings

### Homeric Hymn to Artemis

> I sing of Artemis, whose shafts are of gold, who cheers on the hounds, the pure maiden, shooter of stags, who delights in archery, own sister to Apollo with the golden sword.
> 
> Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends forth her arrows of sorrow. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the outcry of animals. Earth rings with the cry of beasts and the sea with the cry of birds.
> 
> Yet, although she is a maiden, she delights in arrows and kills the daughters of Zeus who makes glad the barking hounds. But when she is satisfied and has cheered her heart, this unwearying maiden who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, to arrange the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces.
> 
> There she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads the dances, gracefully arrayed, while all they utter their heavenly voice, singing how neat-ankled Leto bore children supreme among the immortals both in thought and in deed.
> 
> Hail to you, children of Zeus and rich-haired Leto! And I will remember you and another song as well.


### Prayer for Purity and Strength in Adversity

> O Artemis, Maiden of the Silver Bow,
> In your eternal chastity, your strength does show.
> As you defended your nymphs with fierce might,
> Grant me your resolve to uphold what’s right.
> 
> In the groves of Brauron, where young girls roamed free,
> Your teachings of independence were key.
> Like Callisto, under your starry domain,
> Help me stand unwavering, through loss and pain.
> 
> By the Taurian altar, where Iphigenia served,
> You showed mercy, from cruelty she was swerved.
> In times of trial, when my spirit feels small,
> Infuse me with courage, let me stand tall.


## Born

Eternally young, beautiful goddess was born on Delos at the same time with her brother, the golden-haired Apollo. They are twins. The most sincere love, the most intimate friendship connect brother and sister. The same deeply they love their mother Latona.

## Appearance

Eternally young, beautiful as a clear day, the goddess Artemis, with bow and quiver over her shoulder, a hunter with a spear in her hand, hunts gayly in shady forests and sun-drenched fields. Noisy crowd of nymphs accompany her, and she, majestic, in a short dress fancier, reaching only to the knees, quickly rushes through the wooded slopes of the mountains. No one can escape from her not knowing any slip arrows – neither skittish deer nor the timid deer, wild boar or furious, hiding in the reeds.

## Dance

For Artemis hurry her companion-nymphs. Laughter, screams, barking pack of dogs is far distributed in the mountains, and mountain echo responds to them loudly. When the goddess is tired of the hunt, she hurries with the nymphs to the sacred Delphi, to her beloved brother Apollo. There she is resting. Under divine sounds of golden cittern of Apollo she leads the dances with the Muses and nymphs. Ahead of everyone goes dancing Artemis – slim, beautiful; she is more beautiful than all the nymphs and muses and the whole head is taller than them.

## Rest

Artemis likes to relax in breathing with cool, entwined with the green Grotto, away from the eyes of mortals. Woe to him who disturbs the peace of her. Thus died and the young Actaeon, son of Autonoe, daughter of the Theban king Cadmus.

## Eternal Virgin

Classical Artemis – the eternal virgin; Accompanying her nymphs as a vow of celibacy, and those who do not comply with it – severely punished (like Callisto). Before the wedding to the goddess were brought the redemptive sacrifice. In many myths, she seems vindictive and cruel: kills Actaeon, children of Niobe, tells Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter. Destructive function of Artemis associated with her archaic past – mistress of animals in Crete. In the oldest of her incarnations she is not only the hunter, but also a bear.
