## Book Two

> Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. But to go away from among men, if there are gods, is not a thing to be afraid of, for the gods will not involve thee in evil; but if indeed they do not exist, or if they have no concern about human affairs, what is it to me to live in a universe devoid of gods or devoid of providence?
> 
> 既然生命有可能随时会离你而去，那么就要把该做的做好，该想的想好。假使有神灵，离开世人又有什么好惧怕的呢？因为神灵不会把你卷入邪恶；如果神灵确实不存在，或者他们对人间之事并不关心，那么活在一个没有神灵和天道的宇宙中于我又有何意义呢？

> Remember that all is opinion. For what was said by the Cynic Monimus is manifest: and manifest too is the use of what was said, if a man receives what may be got out of it as far as it is true.
> 
> 记住，一切都是意见。犬儒派的莫尼穆斯说的话意义是很明显的，这些话的用处也是显然的，只要人能在这真实的话中汲取其精华。

> which is able to conduct a man? One thing, and only one—philosophy. But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without a purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man's doing or not doing anything;and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came;
> 
> 什么可以指引人的行为呢？有且只有一种东西，那便是哲学。这包括保持人内心的神明，使其免受摧残和损害，超脱痛苦和快感，做事不要漫无目标或者虚情假意，不感到需要他人做或不做任何事情；除此之外，接受一切已经发生的事情，所有分配的事情，不管它们来自何处，就当它们是从那里、从它们的本源

## Book Three

**重要**: 章节 3.4

> Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility. For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as these, What is such a person doing, and why, and what is he saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he contriving, and whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our thoughts everything that is without a purpose and useless, but most of all the overcurious feeling and the malignant; and a man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? with perfect openness thou mightest immediately answer, This or That; so that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee is simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, one that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments at all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst it in thy mind.
> 
> 不要把你剩下的生命浪费在思考别人的事情上, 除非你所做的是出于共同的利益. 不要总是琢磨别人做什么, 为什么做, 他说什么, 想什么, 算计什么, 如果把注意力分散在诸如此类的事情上, 会使我们难于专注于我们的支配能力. 因此我们不应该把时间浪费在这些毫无意义的空想上, 尤其要抑制我们的好奇心和恶意.; 你必须要训练自己保持这样的想法, 一旦有人突然问起: "你在想什么?" 你也毫不犹豫地说真话: 我在想什么, 而且你的回答能清楚地表明: 你所想的一切都是单纯和善良的, 你是社会中不追求纵欲享乐的一份子, 你也没有任何不满, 嫉妒和猜疑的想法, 或别的说出来会脸红的念头.

> If thou workest at that which is before thee, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract thee, but keeping thy divine part pure, as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately; if thou holdest to this, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, but satisfied with thy present activity according to nature, and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest, thou wilt live happy. And there is no man who is able to prevent this. 
> 
> 如果在做眼前的事，你需要认真、积极、从容地遵从正确的理性，不要让任何别的东西干扰你，保持你神性的纯洁，就好像你立刻就要把它奉还一样；如果你坚持这一点，无所希求，无所畏惧，只是依据本性满足于你现在从事的活动，满足于你说出的每个词、发出的每个音节中具有英雄气概般的真实，你就会过得快乐。没有人能阻止这一点。

> No longer wander at hazard; for neither wilt thou read thy own memoirs, nor the acts of the ancient Romans and Hellenes, and the selections from books which thou wastreserving for thy old age. Hasten then to the end which thou hast before thee, and, throwing away idle hopes, come to thy own aid, if thou carest at all for thyself, while it is in thy power. 
> 
> 不要再随意地游荡了；因为你既不会读自己的回忆录，也不会读古希腊罗马事迹，还有你留着老年阅读的书本节选。那么赶快朝你面前的目标奔去，如果你还珍惜自己，趁着还有能力之时，抛开一切虚妄的希望，救救自己吧。

> And if all men refuse to believe that he lives a simple, modest, and contented life, he is neither angry with any of them, nor does he deviate from the way which leads to the end of life, to which a man ought to come pure, tranquil, ready to depart, and without any compulsion perfectly reconciled to his lot.
> 
> 即使所有人都不相信他过的是一种简单、朴素、满足的生活，他也不会和他们任何人生气，也不会偏离引向生命终点的路，一个人应该是纯洁而宁静地走这条路，随时准备离去，没有丝毫勉强地接受命运的安排。


## Book Four


> Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere, either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble, does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind.
> 
> 人们为自己寻找隐退的地方，乡间小舍、海边、山里。你也非常渴望这些吧。但这完全是最为普通的那一类人的标志，因为你随时可以退隐到你自己心里去。没有什么地方比隐退到自身的灵魂更安静、更远离纷扰，尤其是当他心里有一些想法，只要一想到这些想法，他就能立即获得彻底的安宁；

> 回归准则并尊崇理性

> Do not act as if thou wert going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over thee. While thou livest, while it is in thy power, be good.
> 
> 不去管邻居说什么、做什么或想什么，只关注自己的所作所为是否正当而纯洁；或者，如阿加顿所说，不要去环顾周围别人道德的堕落，而是沿着路线直奔，不要偏离，这样的人可以避免很多麻烦。

> Neither worse then nor better is a thing made by being praised.

> 事物不会因为赞美变得更糟或者更好.

> Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst be tranquil.—But consider if it would not be better to say, Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally social requires, and as it requires.
> 
> 哲人说，如果想要宁静，就少做事情。但是想一想这样说是否更好：做必要的事情，只做本性合群的动物的理性要求的事情，并且像其所要求的那样做。因为这不仅会带来做好事情的宁静，也会带来少做事情的宁静。

> And, to conclude the matter, what is even an eternal remembrance? A mere nothing. What, then, is that about which we ought to employ our serious pains? This one thing, thoughts just, and acts social, and words which never lie, and a disposition which gladly accepts all that happens, as necessary, as usual, as flowing from a principle and source of the same kind.
> 
> 作为结论，永久的记忆是什么呢？不过是虚无。那么，什么是我们应该付出认真和努力的呢？只有一样：思想公正、行为合群、从不撒谎，培养这样一种性情，快乐地接受所发生之事，认为这是必然、正常的，来自同一原则和根源。

> Everything is only for a day, both that which remembers and that which is remembered. 
> 
> 一切都只能存在一天，记忆的人和被记忆的皆如此。

<br>

> Thou wilt soon die, and thou art not yet simple, not free from perturbations, nor without suspicion of being hurt by external things, nor kindly disposed towards all;
> 
> 你不久就会死去，但你还没有达到朴素单纯、无忧无虑，还没能摆脱被外界事物伤害的怀疑，还没有养成善待一切的性情，

> It is no evil for things to undergo change, and no good for things to subsist in consequence of change.
> 
> 事物经历变化不是坏事，而事物靠变化的结果而维持其存在，也不是好事。

> If any god told thee that thou shalt die to-morrow, or certainly on the day after to-morrow, thou wouldst not care much whether it was on the third day or on the morrow, unless thou wast in the highest degree mean- spirited—for how small is the difference—so think it no great thing to die after as many years as thou canst name rather than to-morrow.
> 
> 如果神告诉你，你明天将要死去，或者确定是后天死去，你不会在乎是后天或是明天，除非你在精神上极度的小气，因为这是多么微小的差别。所以，无论你是多少年之后死去还是明天死去，并不要把这看成是什么大事。

> Think continually how many physicians are dead after often contracting their eyebrows over the sick; and how many astrologers after predicting with great pretensions the deaths of others; and how many philosophers after endless discourses on death or immortality; how many heroes after killing thousands; and how many tyrants who have used their power over men's lives with terrible insolence as if they were immortal; and how many cities are entirely dead, so to speak, Helice and Pompeii and Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Add to the reckoning all whom thou hast known, one after another. One man after burying another has been laid out dead, and another buries him; and all this in a short time. To conclude, always observe how ephemeral and worthless human things are, and what was yesterday a little mucus, to-morrow will be a mummy or ashes. Pass then through this little space of time conformably to nature, and end thy journey in content, just as an olive falls off when it is ripe, blessing nature who produced it, and thanking the tree on which it grew.
> 
> 不断地去想想：有多少医生在常常对病人紧锁眉头之后死去了；有多少星相家在煞有介事地预测别人的死亡之后死去了；有多少哲学家在无休止地讨论死亡和不朽之后死去了；有多少英雄杀了成千上万的人之后死去了；有多少仿佛可以永生的暴君在傲慢地行使他们对于别人生命的权力之后死去了；有多少城池彻底毁灭了，比如赫利斯、庞贝和赫库莱尼恩和其他无数地方。再把你所认识的人一个接一个地加上去。一个人在埋葬了别人之后死去了，另一个人来埋葬他。一切都发生在瞬间。总之，人的事情是短暂和没有价值的，昨天是一点点黏液，明天就是木乃伊或灰烬。安然度过这一小段时间而回归自然，满足地结束人生旅程，就如同橄榄成熟后掉落一样，感谢产生它的自然，感谢它寄生的树木。

> Be like the promontory against which the waves continually break, but it stands firm and tames the fury of the water around it. 
> 
> 要像礁石一样，任凭海浪不断拍打，它自岿然不动，驯服周围狂暴的海水。

> Unhappy am I, because this has happened to me.—Not so, but happy am I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future. For such a thing as this might have happened to every man; but every man would not have continued free from pain on such an occasion. Why, then, is that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune?
> 
> 我真不幸，因为这事发生在我身上了。不是这样的，而是想我真幸运，尽管这事发生在我身上了，那是因为我能继续摆脱痛苦，不会被现实碾碎也不惧怕未来。这样的事情可能发生在任何一个人身上，但不是每个人在这种时候都能摆脱痛苦。那为什么是一种不幸而不是一种幸运呢？

> 要走最短的路，最短的路是自然
