# Overview

因为 Faye提醒了我美国果汁会加入糖的问题, 所以开个帖子讨论一下常见的ingredient 的安全摄入量. 

# Sugar

根据 [American Heart Association的建议](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much): 

- Men should consume no more than (**36 grams** or 150 calories) of added sugar per day.

1g sugar contains 4 calories. So basically, all the calories in any juice are provided by sugar. You are not drinking juice, you are drinking sugar.  It is not added sugar though, but the taste is still from sugar.

## 对比标准

什么算糖多, 什么算糖少.  我目前的标准是可乐. 我们认为糖摄入量超过一听可乐的都算多.

一听可乐是上限, 其实一听可乐已经超过了日摄入量的36g. 

## Food swap strategy

Food swap strategy for added sugar

* Swap blueberry flavored yogurt for plain yogurt with fresh blueberries added
* Use avocado as a condiment instead of mayonnaise
* Salsa instead of ketchup
* Oil and vinegar instead of processed salad dressing
* Coconut water instead of sports drinks
* Sparkling water rather than soda
* Cinnamon in coffee instead of sugar
* Eat berries or other fruit as dessert instead of berry-flavored ice cream bars

戒糖是一个任重而道远的任务. 现在2024年一月, 想的就是用 sparkling water 替代无糖可乐, 用水果替代冰激凌.

## FAQ

### Why natural sugar good and added sugar bad? 

According to [ucsd](https://chear.ucsd.edu/blog/understanding-natural-versus-added-sugars)

Fruits and dairy contain fructose and lactose, natural sugar that is digested slower than added sugar and keeps your metabolism stable over time. Sugars found naturally in food are more than enough to sustain your body. **Natural sugars are processed more slowly, meaning your blood glucose level stays elevated for a longer period.**

Added sugars are typically processed quickly, either immediately used for energy or sent directly to the liver for fat storage. **Your blood glucose level drops quickly after eating added sugars, known as a sugar crash, that leaves you hungry, irritable, and usually craving another pickup**. When this happens, you may not be able to make smart choices about what and how much to eat which could contribute to weight gain.

### What does "No added sugars" actually means? 

No added sugars or without added sugars means that no sugars or sugar-containing ingredients were added during processing

# Fat

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

You should limit both total fat and saturated fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats, and less than 7% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum amounts of fats that you should eat:

Calories per Day | 	Total Fat	| Saturated Fat
|------|------|------
1,500	| 42-58 grams |	10 grams
2,000	| 56-78 grams	| 13 grams
2,500	| 69-97 grams	| 17 grams

Saturated fat is a bad fat because it raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.

Trans fat is another bad fat; it can raise your LDL and lower you HDL (good cholesterol). Trans fat is mostly in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as stick margarine, crackers, and french fries.

Instead of these bad fats, try healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils.

# Salt

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

You should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat to** no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day**. That includes all the sodium you eat, whether it was added in cooking or at the table, or already present in food products. 

Limiting salt can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood pressure. You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and "no added salt" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking.

# cholesterol

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than **200 mg** a day of cholesterol.


# Alcohol

Based on medlineplus [recommendation](https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterolwithdiet.html): 

Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. 


One drink is a glass of wine, beer, or a small amount of hard liquor, and the recommendation is that:

* Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day
* Women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day
